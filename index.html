<h4>History</h4>
<p>The NBA (National Basketball Association) is a professional basketball league in North America, considered one of the premier basketball leagues in the world. It was founded in 1946 in New York City as the Basketball Association of America (BAA) before merging with the National Basketball League (NBL) in 1949 to form the NBA.</p>
<h4>Structure</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Teams: There are 30 teams in the NBA, divided into two conferences: the Eastern Conference and the Western Conference. Each conference is further split into three divisions.
    <ul>
        <li>Eastern Conference Divisions: Atlantic, Central, Southeast</li>
        <li>Western Conference Divisions: Northwest, Pacific, Southwest</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Regular Season: Teams play an 82-game regular season, competing against teams from both their conference and the opposing conference.</li>
    <li>Playoffs: After the regular season, the top 8 teams from each conference (16 total) advance to the NBA Playoffs. These playoffs determine the two conference champions, who then face off in the NBA Finals.</li>
    <li>NBA Finals: The NBA Finals is a best-of-seven series between the Eastern and Western Conference champions to determine the league champion.</li>
</ul>
